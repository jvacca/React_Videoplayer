						<p><strong>Elderly people with psychosis related to dementia (for example, an inability to perform daily activities as a result of increased memory loss), treated with antipsychotic medicines including ABILIFY, are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of people with dementia-related psychosis (see Boxed WARNING).</p>
	
						<p>Antidepressants may increase suicidal thoughts or behaviors in some children, teenagers, and young adults, especially within the first few months of treatment or when the dose is changed. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are themselves associated with an increase in the risk of suicide. Patients on antidepressants and their families or caregivers should watch for new or worsening depression symptoms, unusual changes in behavior, or thoughts of suicide. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's healthcare professional right away, especially if they are severe or occur suddenly. ABILIFY is not approved for use in pediatric patients with depression (see Boxed WARNING).</strong></p>
						
						<p><strong>Contraindication</strong>: Patients should not use ABILIFY if they are allergic to aripiprazole or any of the ingredients in ABILIFY. Allergic reactions have ranged from rash, hives, and itching to anaphylaxis, which may include difficulty breathing, tightness in the chest, and swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue.</p>
						
						<p>Serious side effects may include:
						<ul>
						    <li>An <strong>increased risk of stroke</strong> and ministroke have been reported in clinical studies of elderly people with dementia-related psychosis</li>
						    <li>Very high fever, rigid muscles, shaking, confusion, sweating, or increased heart rate and blood pressure. These may be signs of a condition called <strong>neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)</strong>, a rare but serious side effect which could be fatal</li>
						    <li>Uncontrollable movements of face, tongue, or other parts of body as these may be signs of a serious condition called <strong>tardive dyskinesia (TD)</strong>. TD may become permanent and the risk of TD may increase with the length of treatment and the overall dose. While TD can develop after taking the medicine at low doses for short periods, this is much less common. There is no known treatment for TD, but it may go away partially or completely if the medicine is stopped</li>
						    <li>If you have <strong>diabetes</strong>, or risk factors for diabetes (for example, obesity, family history of diabetes), or unexpected increases in thirst, urination, or hunger, your blood sugar should be monitored. <strong>Increases in blood sugar levels</strong> (hyperglycemia), in some cases serious and associated with coma or death, have been reported in patients taking ABILIFY and medicines like it</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>Lightheadedness or faintness caused by a sudden change in heart rate and blood pressure when rising quickly from a sitting or lying position (orthostatic hypotension) has been reported with ABILIFY.</p>
						
						<p>Decreases in white blood cells (infection fighting cells) have been reported in some patients taking antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY. Patients with a history of a significant decrease in white blood cell (WBC) count or who have experienced a low WBC count due to drug therapy should have their blood tested and monitored during the first few months of therapy.</p>
						
						<p>ABILIFY and medicines like it can affect your judgment, thinking, or motor skills. You should not drive or operate hazardous machinery until you know how ABILIFY affects you.</p>
						
						<p>Medicines like ABILIFY<span class='superscript'>®</span> (aripiprazole) can impact your body's ability to reduce body temperature; you should avoid overheating and dehydration.</p>
						
						<p>ABILIFY and medicines like it have been associated with swallowing problems (dysphagia). If you had or have swallowing problems, you should tell your healthcare professional.</p>
						
						<p>Tell your healthcare professional if you have a history of, or are at risk for seizures, or are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Also tell your healthcare professional about all prescription and non-prescription medicines you are taking or plan to take, since there are some risks for drug interactions.</p>
						
						<p>While taking ABILIFY, avoid:
						<ul>
							<li>Drinking alcohol</li><li>Breast-feeding an infant</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>Most common side effects (≥10%) from all clinical trials involving adults include:
						    <ul><li><strong>ADULTS</strong>: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, an inner sense of restlessness or need to move (akathisia), anxiety, insomnia, and restlessness</li></ul>
						</p>
						<p>It is important to contact your healthcare professional if you experience prolonged, abnormal muscle spasms or contractions which may be signs of a condition called dystonia.</p>
